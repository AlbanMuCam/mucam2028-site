        <p>Skritur.eu™ EULA V1, 06/04/2023</p>
<h1>General</h1>
<p>This is a legally binding agreement between you (or your organisation) and Skritur. By purchasing or using our fonts, you are agreeing its terms.</p>
<h1>License Scope</h1>
<p>The font and its design’s intellectual property are exclusively owned by Skritur. When purchasing a License, you are obtaining the non-exclusive right to install and use our fonts on your organisation’s devices. You may also use our fonts on websites, pdfs, applications or any other media produced by your organisation.
The cost of a license is based on the amount of employees in your organisation at the time of purchase.  A license remains valid if the amount of employees increases, provided it was correctly stated at the time of purchase.</p>
<h1>General Restrictions</h1>
<p>You must take all reasonable precautions to ensure our fonts are not accessible to unlicensed third parties or to the general public. You are not permitted to modify, reverse-engineer, reformat, alter, edit, or create derivative works of our fonts without prior written permission from Skritur. You are not permitted to transfer this Agreement to any third party without the prior written permission of Skritur.</p>
<h1>Term</h1>
<p>This Agreement is effective until terminated by either party. If you breach any of its terms, Skritur reserves the right to charge you the cost of a license covering your actual usage of our fonts, on a per-infringement basis and without discounts, and/or terminate the license.</p>
<h1>Warranty</h1>
<p>Skritur makes no warranties, express or implied, as to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or otherwise. If you encounter an issue or problem with our fonts, Skritur will make a good faith effort to provide a fix or replacement within 30 days of being notified. If the issue cannot be reasonably remedied, Skritur may at their discretion offer to refund you, at which point this Agreement will immediately terminate. Skritur shall in no event be liable to you or any other third party for any direct, indirect, consequential or incidental damages arising out of the use or inability to use our fonts, even if notified in advance. Under no circumstances shall Skritur’s liability exceed the cost of the license you purchased. You agree to indemnify and hold Skritur harmless from and against any claims or damage which may result from your misuse of our fonts or breach of this Agreement.</p>
<h1>Legal</h1>
<p>This Agreement is subject to and governed by the laws of France. This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between Skritur and you, and supersedes any prior discussions or negotiations, whether verbal or in writing. No amendment, modification or waiver will be valid or enforceable unless materialised in an agreement signed by Skritur. If any part of this Agreement is found void or unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the rest of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. Skritur’s failure or election not to enforce a provision of this Agreement is not a waiver of its right to do so later. The numberings and section titles within this Agreement are for convenience and shall not affect or alter the meaning or construction of any terms or provisions of the Agreement.</p>
